Chaotic PSO Implementation

Introduction

This repository provides a method-focused implementation of the Chaotic Particle Swarm Optimization (Chaotic PSO) framework. It is designed for researchers, graduate students, and professionals interested in swarm intelligence and chaos-enhanced optimization methods. The fitness function is defined by the user, allowing flexibility for various optimization problems.

Features

• Method-focused Chaotic PSO framework integrating chaotic maps to enhance exploration and convergence.

• Suitable for educational purposes, algorithmic comparisons, and further extensions.

• Parameter values (swarm size, number of iterations, chaos parameters) follow common literature settings but can be adjusted depending on the problem.

Usage

Users can define their own objective function and customize algorithm parameters. This code is written for clarity and reproducibility, making it suitable for research studies, educational use, and comparative analysis with classical PSO or other metaheuristic algorithms.
